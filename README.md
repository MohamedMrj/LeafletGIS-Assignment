Welcome to Webmapp 201, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application. This project allows you to perform basic GIS operations using Leaflet, a popular JavaScript mapping library. You can create, display, and analyze geographic features, interact with locations of interest, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.

3. Customize the project according to your needs.

## Usage

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You'll see a map interface with various buttons for different tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Features

- Use the buttons to create point, line, and polygon features on the map.
- Information about these features, along with an image, will be displayed in pop-up windows.

### Task 2: Locations of Interest

- Choose a city and use the buttons to display five locations of interest (e.g., retail stores, museums) as points on the map.
- Information about each location will be shown in the sidebar, including name, location, and other details.
- Use the "Measure" button to display distances between these locations using the PolylineMeasure Plugin.

### Task 3: Supermarket Analysis

- Load the "supermarket.geoJSON" file to the map.
- Display the names of supermarkets as pop-up windows.
- Create a 1 KM buffer around each supermarket location.
- Highlight supermarkets that do not overlap with each other.

## Additional Functionality (VG)

### Task 4: Image Overlay

- Use an image to overlay on the basemap.
- Choose any location in Sweden and overlay the image for visual reference.
